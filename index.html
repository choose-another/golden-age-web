<h2 class="cannoli">Hi Guys! Welcome to Golden Age's Website!</h2>
<p class="cannoli">I'm Cannoli Romano, everyone's favorite <del>web developer</del> mafia boss!<br>
Here is my <em>very own website</em> dedicated to everything Golden Age that I made entirely from scratch!  Here you can find basically nothing for now! The page is still under construction!</p>

<h2 class="reader">If there's nothing here then why does this even exist!</h2>
<p class="cannoli">Well, ahem <em>someone</em> from a rival gang made his very own website, saying that the Babes and I couldn't beat it!
And I can't let that get past me, especially after he kicked me out of Passione and called me short!  The nerve!  
hAh, but me and Risotta and Bruschetta are so much better than that <em>mafia man</em> and his <em><strong>Mista</strong>ke</em> of a "gang"!<br>

<h2 class="reader">There's no need to be that rude, Cannoli</h2>
<p class="cannoli">What! <em>Rude?!?</em> I'm not being rude, it's just that <em>you</em> think it's fun to make fun of others for their height!
Do you know what I have to deal with every day!  
It's always <em><strong>Cannoli do you need help reaching that?</strong></em> and <em><strong>Cannoli you're so cute</strong></em> and <em><strong>Cannoli you're to short for the ride</strong></em> but never 
<em><strong>Cannoli you are a gorgeous giantess-warrior-godess who literally perfect in all ways and will conquer the seven realms with her unlimited power stemming from her sheer infinate height</strong></em>.</p>

<h2 class="reader">Maybe you're just insecure about how short you are?</h2>
<p class="cannoli"><em>wait...</em><br>
Did you just call me <em>short!?!</em></p>
