<h1>Hi there!<br>I'm assuming you're D</h1>
<h3>This is the most basic form of a website</h3>
<p class="blank">nothing but blank and empty<br>
but could it be more?</p>
<p>As you can probably tell, I have been practicing how to make websites.<br>
I have finished everything on Khan Academy that doesn't require me to learn an entire new coding language so I need to get outside practice.<br>
I think I've come to the level where I can at least attempt to form some sort of "website".<br>
I still am a beginner tho and need motivation + a project to work on.<br>
Getting to the point, would you like me to <em>try</em> to make a website for Golden Age?<br>
Entirely from scratch?</p>
<p class="blank">going back to the "most basic form of a website" there's actually 4 style settings just for emphasis already</p>
