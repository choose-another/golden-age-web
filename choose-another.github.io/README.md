bruh you read this?

I have no idea how you got here

but thanks for coming all this way

I guess I (website creator, not SwaggyPeep) talk about how I got here then.

I got into HTML/CSS just a few weeks ago from while I'm writing this because I couldn't wrap my head around python

This is the first real website I have made and as I am writing this I am not sure how it will turn out.

I rarely follow through on my own without outside influence, so I am forcing myself to go through with this by promising my friend to make a website for her comic.

I'm not sure what I am getting out of learning HTML, I don't even know what I am doing anymore.



For anyone who's interested in seeing the origins:
